The Slashdot Zoo corpus
=======================

This is the Slashdot Zoo corpus, extracted by Jérôme.

zoodir.tar.bz2 contains the original corpus.

The out.* files are generated from that by the code in SVN:

http://cvs/svn/IRML/trunk/zoo/

out.corpus -- The whole corpus with usernames
out.userids -- mapping from usernames to user IDs.  User IDs are continuous and start at one.  User IDs are not those used by Slashdot.
out.matrix -- The corpus in Matlab-readable form, using user IDs.
out.test/training -- subsets of out.matrix for evaluating link sign prediction
out.trolls -- list of known trolls as used in trolls prediction
out.matrix.clean -- subset of out.matrix used for troll prediction evaluation

zoodir.tar.bz2 unpacks to zoodir/, which is the originally extracted data.

Warning:  zoodir/ contains one subdirectory for each user (about 70,000), so be sure not to use any GUI file explorer or ls.  Tab completion for usernames is fast though.
Also, usernames may not be suitable for some filesystems, e.g. those that identify lowercase and uppercase.
Some usernames contain characters that may pose problems for some filesystems or that may need quoting (but no space):  ~ * ! ' ( ) % 
.
